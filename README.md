Real-Time Color Detection using OpenCV

This project is a Python-based real-time color detection application that uses OpenCV to detect and highlight specific colors (red, green, blue, black, and white) from a live camera feed.
---
Features

Detects predefined colors in real-time using the HSV color space.

Draws bounding rectangles around detected objects.

Displays labels indicating the detected color.

Easy to use with live camera input.

Demo

When you run the program:

Hold an object of a predefined color (red, green, blue, black, or white) in front of the camera.

The object will be highlighted with a rectangle in its respective color, and a label will be displayed above it.
